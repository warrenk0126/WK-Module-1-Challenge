# Code Refactor Starter Code

| Comments have been added to segment the HTML elements for convenience
| Title element has been edited to be more descriptive
| Elements have been structured for easier legibility
| img alt attributes have been added
| heading elements have been re-ordered to be sequential

I feel as though I may be misunderstanding the last requisite for acceptence,
but I've done so by grouping the heading styles since the font-size for them
would distort the header sizes should I change them to be numerically sequential.
